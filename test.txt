[Verse 1]
Words hold me down
They're chained to this world
Worse yet to come
We still regret
All those days
So far from me
And all those dreams
So far from reach

[Chorus]
Shame
You never forget
No moment of change
With every regret
One belief falls apart
Two of us not enough
One belief falls from us
Two of us is too much

[Verse 2]
More yet to come
Been training for this
Worse yet to come
We still repent
Where do we go?
There's only this world
Those words haunt me now
We still regret

[Chorus]
Shame
You never forget
No moment of change
With every regret
One belief falls apart
Two of us not enough
One belief falls from us
Two of us is too much
